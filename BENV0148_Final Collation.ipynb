    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Climate change is exerting a significant influence on global weather patterns, as evidenced by the increasing frequency of heatwaves, wildfires, and other extreme weather events. As renewable energy has become central to decarbonization strategies within the power sector, it is critical to understand the long-term impacts of climate change on the performance of renewable energy assets, particularly given that changes in climate patterns can directly affect their energy output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trajectory of future climate conditions depends largely on present-day energy policies and the rate of technological advancement. Several climate models have been developed to project future scenarios based on varying assumptions. Among these, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), developed by the climate science community, provide standardized scenarios that relate different policy choices to levels of radiative forcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this study is to evaluate the impacts of climate change on offshore wind generation in Great Britain under different RCP scenarios. This study focuses on offshore wind in particular as it constitutes a major component of the renewable energy mix in Great Britain. Offshore wind farms have experienced rapid development due to the region’s favourable wind conditions and the advantages offshore sites offer in terms of consistent wind speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep learning approach is applied in conducting this study under two specific scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 — a high-emission, business-as-usual scenario; and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 — a low-emission, best-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings will enable policymakers and stakeholders to better evaluate the resilience of the United Kingdom’s offshore wind strategy and to identify necessary contingencies to maintain long-term energy security.\n",
